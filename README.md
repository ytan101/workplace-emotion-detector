---
This project is based on the FER2013 dataset and is an implementation to try and detect different facial emotions using a Tensorflow implementation
```
git clone https://gitlab.aisingapore.net/aiap/deep-skilling-phase/aiap10/team2.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Using Pre-trained Models
- Create an empty folder in `src` called `models` and load your pre-trained Tensorflow models
